A grid system for *React* projects to keep the layout structured and responsive.

*React Rasta* is a 12 column grid system and works underneath with the *CSS flexbox* layout. But because it can be difficult to work with *CSS flexbox*, *React Rasta* offers a simple *API* so you don't have to worry about that.
